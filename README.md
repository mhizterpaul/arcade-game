## About

This app uses Object Oriented Programming in javascript to create the popular arcade game 'FROGGER'. Feel free to check it out [HERE](https://mhizterpaul.github.io/arcade-game).
I also would appreciate any feedbacks as some bugs might have escaped my diligent and meticulous tests.


## Dependencies
 
 This app requires a modern browser to run as it uses ES6 syntax. So it would not work on IE11 or any other older browser that doesn't support ES6. I will transpile this app  so it can run on any browser with javascript support as soon as it has been reviewed by **_ALC_** .
